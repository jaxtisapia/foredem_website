                <p className="paragraph-simple margin-medium"> We Rise Foundation has experienced rapid growth and expansion since 18
                    Months in office. We collaborated with “Saving Our Gem” of Rutgers University in New Jersey, U.S.A,
                    where we made few donations to victims of 2015, June 3rd misfortune incident. Moreover, we did a
                    clean up exercise in KWASHIBU, Accra and resulted gutters to abate flood.
                    The Society has helped 60 mentorship scholarships from MR. Kwame Awuah Darko (CEO of Tema Oil
                    Refinery, BOST oil & Vanguard Assurance) to students including the physically Challenged in Kwame

                    Ghana (UG)
                    We Rise foundation has also been able to organize fundraising games For the Ghana Society of
                    Physically Challenged (GSPD) in Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST).We had
                    the partnership of Dr. Emmanuel Marfo
                    (senior research scientist and part time lecturer in Natural Resource Policy Governance), KNUST SRC,

                    Fm and CEDRES.</p>

                <p className="paragraph-simple margin-medium"> We were able to organize a football match between the Ashanti Regional
                    Amputee soccer team and KNUST football team which was a 2 goals draw game. All to prove to the world
                    that #Disability is not an inability.
                    The national Disability Basketball team also exhibited its prowess on the basketball field.
                    The main focus of the program was to propagate that Disability is not an inability, to eradicate if
                    not abate the perception or stigmatization our disabity friends encounters in their learning
                    environs . To promote UNITY, in as much of seeing ourselves as one people.
                    The foundation has paternered with Ghana Society of Physically Challenged and creating jobs for
                    persons with disability mushroom business. Currently, we have over 250 persons with disability
                    employed in our nation.
                    According to Article 4 in the Ghana Federation of Disability , it states memebers shall be opened to
                    all organisations of Persons with Disability and in the case of persons with intellectual disability
                    and any other disability of the like, organisations working for them..
                    Base on this Article the foundation is in a memorandum of understanding with Ghana Society of
                    Physically challenged , as the sole group that work in schools or serve as a bridge between GSPD and
                    all students in tertiary schools.
                    The foundation was recently awarded by the government by given us 500 slot to place students most
                    especially the physically challenged in place of preference through the NATIONAL SERVICE
                    SECRETERIATE headed by Hon. Henry Boakye ..the National service Director.
                    During the election 2016, the foundation was able to hold dialogue with various Aspirants at GREAT
                    hall .. KNUST Sponsored by Yfm and STAR GH
                    It was a successful program which enabled the students to ask questions about what good plans they
                    have the country.</p>

                <p className="paragraph-simple margin-medium"> CPP Presidential Aspirant Hon, IVOR KOBINA GREENSTREET, DR EMMANUEL
                    MARFO ..MP OF OFORIKUROM and the then Deputy chief of HON JOHNNY OSEI KOFI who are all stakeholder
                    of the foundation, were present to honor our invitation.
                    We had another maiden program of its kind the next day after the POLITICAL DIALOGUE at KUMASI SPORTS
                    STADIUM we did a get together ceremony for all parents and their kids with CEREBRAL PALSY. WE Had
                    the government support grantind us free venue and drugs from LEAP..other private companies came to
                    support including Fredemens CHEMIST , Indomie and etc.
                    The currently the foundation is working with MANHYIA PALACE on KIDS with special needs especially
                    kids suffering from cerebral palsy. We are working to sensitize the people in Ghana on the plight of
                    these kids, to create an advocacy to support and protect their fundamental human rights .People have
                    very little knowledge about special needs kids and they are associated with spiritual deity and
                    rivers or a pibishment from the gods for a crime.Most of these are killed either by poisoning,
                    thrown into a river or left to their fate. WOMEN suffer the most at the birth of a special needs kid
                    in Ghana.It is against this backdrop that Werise foundation is embarking on this journey of hope to
                    bring out the silent cries of these kids with this awareness creation on them and help support with
                    their urgent needs as assistive devices for their independence and inclusion in society.
                    Our TV program will bring all it is in the caring fot children with spenial needs to speed up their
                    inclusion in the main stream schools and day to day activities.
                    The hardwork of the foundation has not gone unrecognized</p>
